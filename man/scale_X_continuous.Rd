\usage{
scale_T_continuous(
  name = waiver(),
  limits = NULL,
  breaks = waiver(),
  minor_breaks = waiver(),
  labels = waiver(),
  ...
)

scale_L_continuous(
  name = waiver(),
  limits = NULL,
  breaks = waiver(),
  minor_breaks = waiver(),
  labels = waiver(),
  ...

  name = waiver(),

  labels = waiver(),
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{name}{The name of the scale. Used as the axis or legend title. If
\code{waiver()}, the default, the name of the scale is taken from the first
mapping used for that aesthetic. If \code{NULL}, the legend title will be
omitted.}

\item{limits}{One of:
\itemize{
\item \code{NULL} to use the default scale range
\item A numeric vector of length two providing limits of the scale.
Use \code{NA} to refer to the existing minimum or maximum
\item A function that accepts the existing (automatic) limits and returns
new limits. Also accepts rlang \link[rlang:as_function]{lambda} function
notation.
Note that setting limits on positional scales will \strong{remove} data outside of the limits.
If the purpose is to zoom, use the limit argument in the coordinate system
(see \code{\link[ggplot2:coord_cartesian]{coord_cartesian()}}).
}}

\item{breaks}{One of:
\itemize{
\item \code{NULL} for no breaks
\item \code{waiver()} for the default breaks computed by the
\link[scales:new_transform]{transformation object}
\item A numeric vector of positions
\item A function that takes the limits as input and returns breaks
as output (e.g., a function returned by \code{\link[scales:breaks_extended]{scales::extended_breaks()}}).
Note that for position scales, limits are provided after scale expansion.
Also accepts rlang \link[rlang:as_function]{lambda} function notation.
}}

\item{minor_breaks}{One of:
\itemize{
\item \code{NULL} for no minor breaks
\item \code{waiver()} for the default breaks (none for discrete, one minor break
between each major break for continuous)
\item A numeric vector of positions
\item A function that given the limits returns a vector of minor breaks. Also
accepts rlang \link[rlang:as_function]{lambda} function notation. When
the function has two arguments, it will be given the limits and major
break positions.
}}

\item{labels}{One of the options below. Please note that when \code{labels} is a
vector, it is highly recommended to also set the \code{breaks} argument as a
vector to protect against unintended mismatches.
\itemize{
\item \code{NULL} for no labels
\item \code{waiver()} for the default labels computed by the
transformation object
\item A character vector giving labels (must be same length as \code{breaks})
\item An expression vector (must be the same length as breaks). See ?plotmath for details.
\item A function that takes the breaks as input and returns labels
as output. Also accepts rlang \link[rlang:as_function]{lambda} function
notation.
